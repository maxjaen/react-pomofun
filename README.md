# Pomofun

I've created a new implementation of the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) with the frontend framework __React__. <br>
The pomodoro technique can be used to boost your productivity and to stay sane at the same time. Click the start button to try it out yourself! <br>
After each pomodoro, you will get a small break. Please stand up and move a little bit during that time. Also make sure that you stay hydrated. After for 4 pomodoros you will get an even bigger break. Repeat that a few times during the week and celebrate yourself over all the things you have archived!

<br>

Instead of deploying it for yourself, [here](https://pomofun.herokuapp.com) you can find this app deployed via the deployment provider heroku.

`Please note that heroku has specific rules for user of their free deployment plan. If the website was not called within a span of 30 minutes, the next start could take up to 40s. The app also have to sleep a few hours during the day as far as i know.`
